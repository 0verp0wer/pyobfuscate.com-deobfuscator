### ‚ùó Why I released this code?
- pyobfuscate.com is a skidded obfuscator, the staff of the website has always used algorithms and codes of other people without ever giving credits to them
- when they first released the site they were using [Berserker](https://github.com/billythegoat356/Berserker/)
- later they started using [pycloak](https://github.com/addi00000/pycloak)
- now they are using [razvan obfuscator](https://github.com/im-razvan/Python-Obfuscator)

### ‚öôÔ∏è Instruction

-2: download the deobfuscator

-3: in the same folder put the obfuscated script
