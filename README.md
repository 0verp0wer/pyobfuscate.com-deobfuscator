### pyobfuscate.com deobfuscator
- The first pyobfuscate.com deobfuscator open source

### ❗ Why I release this code?
- pyobfuscate.com is a skidded obfuscator, the staff of the site has always used algorithms and codes of other people without ever giving credits
- when they first released the site they used [Berserker](https://github.com/billythegoat356/Berserker/)
- later they started using [pycloak](https://github.com/addi00000/pycloak)
- now they are using [razvan obfuscator](https://github.com/im-razvan/Python-Obfuscator)

### ⚙️ Instruction

-1: install python  

-2: download the deobfuscator

-3: in the same folder put the obfuscated script      

-4: open cmd and write python deobfuscator.py  

-5: put the name of your obfuscated file
